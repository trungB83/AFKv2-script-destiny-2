# AFK-AHK

> [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) is required in order to execute this script in Destiny 2. Many mouse software apps like Razer Synapse can create macros that will accomplish the same thing. This is intended for users who do not have the functionality in their mouse software or want a script that is more universal and flexible to use.

## How-To-Use

1. Install AutoHotKey by visiting [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Right click on your desktop or File Explorer -> New -> Autohotkey Script. Name it whatever you desire.
3. Right click on the file and hit Edit. Copy and paste the contents of the `AFK.ahk` file in this repository either by going [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adushaj/AFK-AHK/master/AFK.ahk) and save.
4. Right click on the file, hit `run script` then go into Destiny 2 and enter the activity you wish to idle in.

At this point, the script is loaded but is not executing the events until you hit a hotkey.

- To start executing, hit code number and then confirm.
- To pause or resume the execution, hit `Pause/Break`.
- To completely shut down the script, hit `CTRL + F12`. Note that this command will require you to minimize Destiny 2 and run step 4 above. This should only be used in the event you cannot regain control of your PC.

## Disclaimer
~~I have not thoroughly tested if this is capable of fooling Destiny 2's AFK Kicker. I will adjust the steps until I am confident it works.~~
As of 28/10/24, this is confirmed working in Vanguard Strikes, NF, Onslaught
